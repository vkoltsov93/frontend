        <b>Alice</b> was <span class="text">beginning to get very tired</span> of sitting by her sister on the bank, and
        of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no
        pictures or <s>conversations in it</s>, ‘and what is the use of a book,’ thought Alice ‘without pictures or
        conversations?’
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>So she was considering in her</u> own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy
        and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking
        the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
    </p>
    <p>
        There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so <em>very</em> much out of the way to
        hear the Rabbit say to itself, ‘Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!’ (when she thought it over afterwards, it
        occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when
        the Rabbit actually <i>took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket</i>, and looked at it, and then hurried on,
        Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a
        waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it,
        and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
